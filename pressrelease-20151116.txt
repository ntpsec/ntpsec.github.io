FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 2015-11-16

= NTP Security Project announces public development release =

Today, the NTP Security Project announced the first public development release of NTPsec.

NTPsec is an implementation of the “Network Time Protocol” or
“NTP”. NTP is how the internet keeps correct time, which is critically
important for cybersecurity and for auditing, and is necessary for
online finance, cloud computing, media streaming, data storage, email,
calendaring, and for keeping the clock on your desktop set.

NTPsec is based on the original reference implementation created by
Dr. David L. Mills, now Professor Emeritus at the University of
Delaware and one of the original creators of the Internet itself.

As a “developer release”, NTPsec 0.9 is offered to open source
developers and to government, corporate, and academic software and IT
labs for feedback and code contributions.  The project uses modern
open source community development practice, including Git distributed
version control and permissive open source licensing.  Development
will drive to a production-ready 1.0 release, and beyond.

The goal of the project is to harden against security vulnerabilities
and especially against “amplification attacks” that threaten the
stability of the entire Internet.  The project welcomes the
participation of information security researchers, and practices
Responsible Disclosure.
