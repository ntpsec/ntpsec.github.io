We encourage community involvement.  Here are some of the ways you can
contribute:

== Report bugs and send patches ==

Open-source code review is the heart of our process. We welcome bug
reports and fix patches. We'll be happy to work with casual contributors,
casual contributors who want to become regulars, and regulars who aspire
to join the core team.

== Sign up as a platform maintainer ==

The core team can't be everywhere, nor can we cover every operating
system and hardware platform collaboration.  If the POSIX/C99 build
breaks in your special environment, consider working with us as
a platform maintainer.

== Donate to support the project ==

NTP is critical infrastructure that has fallen into disrepair.
There's a lot of work that needs to be done on it.  The core
team has the skills and experience to get the job done, but
it's going to take many person-years of concentrated attention
to get it done - beyond the limit of what unpaid voluntarism
can sustain.  Also, some of the test hardware we need is
specialized and expensive.

Accurate time is the beating pulse of the Internetted world economy.
If you are a business or government agency or wealthy individual that
relies on the Internet, you rely on NTP.  We accept tax-deductible
donations through the http://icei.org[Internet Civil Engineering
Institute].  Please give generously - the civilization you
save may be your own.
