<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>More FAQs will be added here as we discover that they are FAQs.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_ntpsec">Why NTPsec?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTPsec was forked from NTP Classic 4.3.34 in early 2015 after many
installations of NTP Classic were repeatedly exploited as amplifiers
in distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This failure didn&#8217;t happen at random. NTP Classic has long neglected
open-source best practices, and stagnated as a result. The code needed
to be fixed, and the development practice around it reformed.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_should_we_believe_your_security_reliability_claims">Why should we believe your security/reliability claims?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NTPsec team combines the expertise of senior developers from
NTP Classic, the <a href="http://www.catb.org/gpsd">GPSD project</a>, and the
<a href="https://www.rtems.org/">RTEMS Project</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>GPSD has an exceptional record of reliability and security over a
decade of literally billions of deployments in mobile and embedded
systems ranging from smartphones through life-critical navigation
systems to military and aerospace applications.  You rely on it every
time you use Google Maps.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>RTEMS is the real-time operating system used in deep-space missions.
It is ultra-reliable because it has to be; there&#8217;s no on-site
tech support a million miles from Earth.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Applying that GPSD and RTEMS experience to NTP combines the best in
modern high-reliability software engineering with the proven
excellence of the NTP Classic core algorithms.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_will_ntpsec_fully_interoperate_with_ntp_classic">Will NTPsec fully interoperate with NTP Classic?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTPsec <em>will</em> fully interoperate with NTP Classic.  They use the same
protocols and the same time adjustment algorithms.  User-visible
differences are minor, and consist mostly of obsolete code being dropped
and a few tools renamed to reduce NTPsec&#8217;s footprint in global namespace.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_do_these_web_pages_look_so_1990s">Why do these web pages look so 1990s?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Because that simple look is good for people with visual impairments,
and as a tribute to Dr. David Mills, the original architect of NTP
who is himself visually impaired.  Dr. Mills has very particular
ideas about Web visuals, and this site is carefully styled to
resemble his NTP documentation pages.</p></div>
