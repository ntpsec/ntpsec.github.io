= Feature removals =

The aim of the NTPsec project is high security, availability, and assurance.
The more code we can throw away, the fewer potential vulnerabilities
and complexity issues we will have.

Accordingly, we have already removed many obsolete features, and have
a schedule of more feature removals planned.  If something on this
list is important to you, tell us.  If the complexity cost of keeping
it is low, you win.  If the complexity cost is high, then we will need
a donation of engineering time or money to support keeping it in the
codebase.

== Removals already complete ==

The ntpdc utility has been entirely removed.  (All its capabilities are
available through ntpq with a similar user unterface.)  Support for
Mode 7 packets in ntpd has been removed along with it, significantly
reducing total attack surface and code complexity.

The ntpsnmpd daemon, being half-complete and not fully conformant with
RFC 5907, has been removed.  In a future release we would be open to
replacing it with a conformant implementation.

The long-deprecated ntpdate program has been replaced with a shell
wrapper around sntp.

We have removed the following refclock drivers, which were either
broken and won't compile on modern systems (12, 21), or irretrievably
obsolete due to the WWVB modulation change in 2013 (3, 19, 32, 34,
36), or had unfixable Y2K issues (37), or unfixable security issues
(16, 43), or were deprecated in NTP Classic and had their
documentation removed (13, 14, 17).

|==============================================================
|Type 3: PSTI/Traconex 1020 WWV/WWVH Receiver (WWV_PST)
|Type 12: KSI/Odetics TPRO/S IRIG Interface
|Type 13: Leitch CSD 5300 Master Clock Controller (ATOM_LEITCH)
|Type 14: EES M201 MSF Receiver (REFCLOCK_MSF_EES)
|Type 16: Bancomm GPS/IRIG Receiver (GPS_BANCOMM)
|Type 17: Datum Precision Time System (GPS_DATUM)
|Type 19: Heath WWV/WWVH Receiver (WWV_HEATH)
|Type 21: TrueTime GPS-VME Interface (GPS_VME)
|Type 32: Chrono-log K-series WWVB receiver (CHRONOLOG)
|Type 34: Ultralink WWVB Receivers (ULINK)
|Type 36: Radio WWV/H Audio Demodulator/Decoder (WWV)
|Type 37: Forum Graphic GPS Dating station (FG)
|Type 43: RIPE NCC interface for Trimble Palisade
|==============================================================

In addition, support for WWVB and OMEGA has been removed from
Type 5 (TrueTime) driver. Support for GPS and GOES has been retained.

You may be unable to build NTPsec on a sufficiently archaic big-iron
Unix platform.  Support for the native APIs of any version that last
shipped in the last century has been removed. The codebase assumes
full POSIX.1-2001 and C99 conformance including ANSI pthreads; in some
cases you may be able to meet this requirement by upgrading to a
modern GCC- or clang-based toolchain

Platform-dependent kernel-space code that raised potential security
issues has been removed.  No programs access /dev/kmem directly any
longer, and STREAMS support for the parse driver has been deleted.

Support for VMS has been removed, and is unlikely to be restored
unless that platform has achieved effectively full standards
conformance and someone interested throws engineering time and money
at us.  Likewise for VxWorks.

== Suppressed code ==

While we are not removed the Windows code, we will not ship with
Windows supported until that platform has an active port maintainer.

An implementation of the Autokey public-key-based authentication
system is still present in the codebasee, but we don't support
building with it. This feature is broken and has serious security
vulnerabilities.  One of our longer-term projects is to re-engineer
it.

== Obsolete refclocks ==

We consider a refclock driver obsolete if it fails any of the
following tests:

1. It has been discontinued for seven or more years and cannot be
   found for sale on the Web. Types 5, 9, 10, 26, 27, 35, 37, 38, 41.

2. Duplicates capabilities of GPSD, which specializes in GPSes.
   Types 20, 29, 30, 31.

3. Deprecated by the NTP Classic documentation in favor of orphan mode
   (type 1).

4. Accuracy an order of magnitude worse than a cheap 1PPS GPS. Types
   6, 7, 33.

Thus, we plan to remove the following refclock drivers:

|==========================================================
|Type 1: Undisciplined Local Clock
|Type 5: TrueTime GPS/GOES Receivers (TRUETIME)
|Type 6: IRIG Audio Decoder (IRIG_AUDIO)
|Type 7: Radio CHU Audio Demodulator/Decoder (CHU)
|Type 9: Magnavox MX4200 GPS Receiver (GPS_MX4200)
|Type 10: Austron 2200A/2201A GPS Receivers (GPS_AS2201)
|Type 20: Generic NMEA GPS Receiver (NMEA)
|Type 27: Arcron MSF Receiver (MSF_ARCRON)
|Type 29: Trimble Navigation Palisade GPS (GPS_PALISADE)
|Type 30: Motorola UT Oncore GPS GPS_ONCORE)
|Type 31: Rockwell Jupiter GPS (GPS_JUPITER)
|Type 33: Dumb Clock (DUMBCLOCK)
|Type 35: Conrad Parallel Port Radio Clock (PCF)
|Type 38: hopf GPS/DCF77 6021/komp for Serial Line (HOPF_S)
|Type 41: TrueTime 560 IRIG-B Decoder (REFCLK_TT560)
|==========================================================

Removing 6 and 7 means we will be able to remove all the
hair for audio card support.

This will leave the following drivers in place:

|==========================================================
|Type 4: Spectracom GPS Receivers (SPECTRACOM)
|Type 8: Generic Reference Driver (PARSE)
|Type 11: Arbiter 1088A/B GPS Receiver (GPS_ARBITER)
|Type 18: NIST/USNO/PTB Modem Time Services (ACTS_MODEM)
|Type 22: PPS Clock Discipline (PPS)
|Type 26: Hewlett Packard 58503A GPS Receiver (GPS_HP)
|Type 28: Shared Memory Driver (SHM)
|Type 39: hopf GPS/DCF77 6039 for PCI-Bus (HOPF_P)
|Type 40: JJY Receivers (JJY)
|Type 42: Zyfer GPStarplus Receiver
|Type 44: NeoClock4X - DCF77 / TDF serial line
|Type 45: Spectracom TSync PCI
|Type 46: GPSD NG client protocol
|==========================================================
